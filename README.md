# ExtremONet-MLDE
ExtremONet: Extreme-Learning-based Neural Operator for
identifying dynamical systems.

respository for the MLDE ECAI workshop. The datasets are too large to upload onto github, but new ones can be generated by the provided ODE.py and PDE.py python files. Alternatively, upon request, I can send the files via other means.
